# Primodium Developer Docs and Examples

This monorepo contains documentation and examples for Primodium developers.

## Directories

```bash
/docs
/examples
  /world-extension-minimal # TODO for Cometshock
  /building-upgrade-bounty # TODO for Cometshock
```

NOTE: The example MUD projects in `examples` are meant to be used independently as templates. A `packages` directory will be created for relevant external packages for world extension examples in the future.
