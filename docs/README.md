# Primodium Developer Docs

Primodium developer docs for plugin and asset builders.

## Local Development

First, run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies. Then, run `pnpm dev` to start the development server and visit localhost:3000.

## TODO

- Custom theme with Primodium font `@fontsource/space-mono`
- Component templates with Primodium headers instead of boilerplate Nextra
