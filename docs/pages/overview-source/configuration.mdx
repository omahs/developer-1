# Prototype Configs

**Prototype Configuration** files in Primodium are used to define the game's configuration data. During our game design and balancing processes, we needed to frequently change game data such as resource prices, building costs, and factory production.

Inspired by [Sky Strife's](https://github.com/latticexyz/skystrife-public) templates, we developed internal scripts to generate [Foundry scripts](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting) from JSON objects and CSV files. This allows us to quickly iterate between play tests.

The prototype generation utilities are listed below.
