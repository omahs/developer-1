# Source for Primodium System Interfaces

- [`/contract-source/codegen/world`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/developers/blob/main/contract-source/codegen/world): Generated Solidity interfaces for each publicly-accessible system.

## Primodium Systems in World Extensions

The example [`building-upgrade-bounty`](../world-extension/examples.mdx) world extension requires a reference to functions in the Primodium `UpgradeBuildingSystem`, which handles building upgrades. This is done as follows:

First, locate the [`IUpgradeBuildingSystem`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/developers/blob/main/contract-source/codegen/world/IUpgradeBuildingSystem.sol) interface in the `codegen/world` directory. Locate the function signature of the function you want to use, which is `upgradeBuilding()`, and add to both a contract with the same function signature and an interface in the world extension.

```solidity filename="/contract-source/codegen/world/IUpgradeBuildingSystem.sol" showLineNumbers {6}
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.8.21;
import { PositionData } from "codegen/index.sol";

interface IUpgradeBuildingSystem {
  function upgradeBuilding(PositionData memory coord) external returns (bytes32 buildingEntity);
  // ...
}
```

```solidity filename="/contract-source/codegen/world/interfaces.sol" showLineNumbers {5}
pragma solidity >=0.8.21;
import { PositionData } from "../codegen/index.sol";

interface WorldWithUpgradeBuilding {
  function upgradeBuilding(PositionData memory coord) external returns (bytes32 buildingEntity);
  // ...
}
```

Run `pnpm run build` in the `building-upgrade-bounty` world extension.

The `upgradeBuilding()`function in `BuildSystem` can then be called as follows, with `UpgradeBuildingS` being the system ID of the Primodium `UpgradeBuildingSystem` cut off at 16 bytes. See [footguns](../world-extension/footguns.mdx) for more details.

```solidity copy filename="/examples/building-upgrade-bounty/packages/contracts/src/systems/UpgrBounSystem.sol" showLineNumbers {19-25}
pragma solidity >=0.8.21;
import { WorldResourceIdLib, ROOT_NAMESPACE } from "@latticexyz/world/src/WorldResourceId.sol";
import { RESOURCE_SYSTEM } from "@latticexyz/world/src/worldResourceTypes.sol";
import { IWorldWithUpgradeBuilding } from "../interfaces/IWorldWithUpgradeBuilding.sol";

contract UpgrBounSystem is System {
  /**
   * @dev Upgrades the building at the specified coordinate using the bounty published by the given address.
   * @param bountyPublisherAddress The address of the bounty publisher.
   * @param coord The coordinate of the building to upgrade.
   * @return newBuildingEntity The new building entity.
   */
  function upgradeForBounty(
    address bountyPublisherAddress,
    PositionData memory coord
  ) public returns (bytes memory newBuildingEntity) {
    // ...
    // Call the upgradeBuilding function from the World contract
    ResourceId upgradeBuildingSystemId = WorldResourceIdLib.encode(RESOURCE_SYSTEM, ROOT_NAMESPACE, "UpgradeBuildingS");

    newBuildingEntity = IWorldWithUpgradeBuilding(_world()).callFrom(
      bountyPublisherAddress,
      upgradeBuildingSystemId,
      abi.encodeWithSignature("upgradeBuilding((int32,int32,bytes32))", (coord))
    );
    // ...
  }
}

```
