# Account Authorization

## Why?

Players should be able to play Primodium with their web3 identity, typically an account linked to ENS and stored in a high-security wallet like Metamask, Rainbow, or Ledger. But when a player wants to execute a transaction with this wallet, they face multiple steps of transaction confirmation, which makes gameplay laborious.

Using MUD's integrated [callFrom](https://mud.dev/world/systems#calling-systems), we let players play with their account without needing to confirm every transaction. This is done by authorizing a locally stored session account to execute transactions on behalf of the player.

## How to Authorize a Session Account

_Note that upon spawning players automatically authorize a session account._

1. Click the `MANAGE` button in the Account Widget

2. Click the button to authorize a randomly generated session account. Its private key will be stored in the browser's local storage.

3. Confirm with Metamask

4. You are now able to send transactions without confirming each time!

## How does it work?

When you authorize an account, you grant permission for it to perform transactions for you. When an authorized account calls the `callFrom` function, the MUD system being accessed will run using the player account as the msg.sender. (This is possible because MUD uses an abstracted `msgSender()` instead of the default Solidity `msg.sender`).

Once the player account revokes authorization access, the session wallet can no longer use `callFrom` to impersonate the player.
