# Setup Your Plugin

Primodium is a fully onchain application with a supported set of delegation and extension methods for player plugins. Our contracts are built and compliant with the open-source [MUD standard](https://www.mud.dev) for large-scale Ethereum applications.

## Initialize

All smart contracts that interface directly with the Primodium world contract must also implement the MUD standard. To start developing with Primodium, you will need to create a MUD project.

The following is adapted from the [MUD documentation](https://mud.dev/quickstart).

1. Ensure you have [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager#macos), [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation) and [`foundry`](https://getfoundry.sh/) installed.
1. Create and start the application:

   ```sh copy
   pnpm create mud@next my-project && cd my-project && pnpm dev
   ```

1. Select the template to use.
1. Browse to the application.
   Usually it is at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), but if that port is in use it might be 3001, 3002, etc.

## Examples

See [examples](./examples) for working examples of Primodium plugins.
