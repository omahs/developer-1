# Setup Your World Extension

Because all Primodium contracts are built and compliant with the open-source [MUD standard](https://www.mud.dev), for large-scale Ethereum applications, all smart contracts that interface directly with the Primodium world contract should also implement the MUD standard for a better developer experience.

## Initialize

To start developing with Primodium, you will need to create a MUD project.

1. Ensure you have [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager#macos), [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation) and [`foundry`](https://getfoundry.sh/) installed.
1. Complete the [MUD world extension tutorial](https://mud.dev/guides/extending-a-world).
1. Use the following command at the root of your project to initialize your extension's
   MUD version to the same as Primodium's MUD version:

```bash copy
pnpm mud set-version --version 2.0.0-main-9ef3f9a7 && pnpm i && pnpm build
```

4. Any time you have used the `<namespace>__<function>` pattern in your code, replace it with the
   `<namespace>_<system>_<function>` pattern.
   - This is due to our current MUD version being slightly older than the extension tutorial's MUD version.
5. Set the `WORLD_ADDRESS` in your `.env` file and to the live Primodium world contract address.
6. Set the `worlds.json` file to the following `10017` chainID and substitute in the world address:

```json copy
{
  "10017": {
    "address": "PRIMODIUM_WORLD_ADDRESS_HERE"
  }
}
```
