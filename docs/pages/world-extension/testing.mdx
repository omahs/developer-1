# Testing Your World Extension

Given that the Primodium core contracts are not yet released as 
open source (coming soon!), there are limited methods for testing 
your world extension at this time. Currently the best way to test
your world extension is by forking the Primodium live testnet using
Foundry.

### Forking the Primodium Testnet

You can [use Foundry to fork](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/create-select-fork) 
the Primodium testnet to use for your own internal testing prior to deploying your world 
extension to the live Primodium testnet.

```solidity copy
function createSelectFork(string calldata urlOrAlias) external returns (uint256);
```

As also seen in [Deploy Extension](./deploy-extension.mdx), the current Primodium testnet URL is `https://primodium-sepolia.rpc.caldera.xyz/http`.
