# Testing Your World Extension

Since the Primodium core contracts are not open source yet (coming soon!), there are limited methods for testing
your world extensions at this time. Currently, the best way is to fork the Primodium live testnet using
[Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).

## Forking the Primodium Testnet

You can use Foundry to [fork](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/create-select-fork)
the Primodium testnet to use for your own internal testing prior to deploying your world
extension to the live Primodium testnet.

```solidity copy
function createSelectFork(string calldata urlOrAlias) external returns (uint256);
```

As also seen in the extension [deploy guide](./deploy.mdx), the current Primodium testnet URL is `https://primodium-sepolia.rpc.caldera.xyz/http`.
