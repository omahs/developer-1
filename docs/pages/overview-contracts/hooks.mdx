# Hooks: On-Chain Events

**Primodium hooks** are contracts that are defined to react to specific parts of the codebase. Hooks can be thought of as [subsystems](./systems.mdx#subsystems) that are frequently called before or after core system functions.

Hooks allow us to decouple the core logic from secondary and reactionary logic. Hooks are also a workaround to smart contract size limits set by [EIP-170](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-170), which prevents adding features by directly increasing the size of core system contracts.

In the open MUD standard, hooks can react to both system calls and tables. Tables hooks are used throughout Primodium contracts, unlike system hooks are replaced with subsystems and modifiers.

## Table Hooks

Table Hooks allows us to define reactionary logic to changes to a table values. They are based on [store hooks](https://mud.dev/store/store-hooks) as implemented in the open MUD standard.

Table Hooks allow us to define tables with values dependant on other tables but keep their logic decoupled. The most common hook is the `claimResources` subsystem, which updates resource counts to their up-to-date values.

The following is an example of another hook subscribed to the `Score` table and updates the `AllianceScore` table whenever an alliance member score is updated.

```solidity filename="/packages/contracts/src/hooks/storeHooks/OnScore_Alliance_Score.sol" copy showLineNumbers
/// @title OnScore_Alliance_Score - Updates alliance scores based on player scores.
contract OnScore_Alliance_Score is StoreHook {
  constructor() {}

  /// @dev This function is called before splicing static data.
  /// @param keyTuple The key tuple of the player score.
  /// @param start The start position of the data.
  /// @param data The data to be processed.
  function onBeforeSpliceStaticData(
    ResourceId,
    bytes32[] memory keyTuple,
    uint48 start,
    bytes memory data
  ) public override {
    bytes32 playerEntity = keyTuple[0];
    bytes32 allianceEntity = PlayerAlliance.getAlliance(playerEntity);

    // Check if the player is part of an alliance
    if (allianceEntity == 0) {
      // If the player is not part of an alliance, there is no alliance score to update
      return;
    }

    bytes memory newScoreRaw = SliceInstance.toBytes(SliceLib.getSubslice(data, start));
    uint256 newScore = abi.decode(newScoreRaw, (uint256));
    uint256 oldScore = Score.get(playerEntity);
    uint256 allianceScore = Alliance.getScore(allianceEntity);

    if (newScore > oldScore) {
      uint256 scoreDiff = newScore - oldScore;
      Alliance.setScore(allianceEntity, allianceScore + scoreDiff);
    } else {
      uint256 scoreDiff = oldScore - newScore;
      Alliance.setScore(allianceEntity, allianceScore - scoreDiff);
    }
  }
}
```
