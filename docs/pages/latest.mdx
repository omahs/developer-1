## Changelog

v0.10.0 is our biggest update to date. Weâ€™ve changed and added the following:

- Motherlode asteroids are now colonizable and buildable.
- All asteroids have an `Encryption` attribute to them that prevents colonization.
- Units are now organized into `Fleets`, which are groups of units that stay in orbit.
- Fleets can be used to attack other fleets in orbit or defend an asteroid from orbit.
- Added miners for kimberlite, titanium, iridium, and platinum for use on other asteroids.
- Resources are transferrable between motherlodes and are tied to fleet cargo.
- You can now build contract-side plugins for player coordination.
