# World Extension Structure

1. Register namespace
    - This is where your world extension will live. It is the root of your
    extension and is how access controls and tables are managed. Don't forget
    that the namespace admin has the ability to modify any table or system in the
    namespace, so be careful who you give namespace access to!
2. Register new tables
    - Any additional state not already included in the World should be added
    as a new table. You can also read the tables outside of this namespace,
    but you are still subject to their system constraints for writing to them.
3. Register systems needed in your namespace
    - Any system that you plan on using should be 
    registered in to your namespace. Note that if the
    system has already been deployed on the chain and used in another
    namespace, you can use the same system! (Don't forget that systems are only
    safe if they are stateless!)
4. Register functions from your systems
    - Functions are tied to the namespace, so you need to register each function
    so that it is accessible through the World.
