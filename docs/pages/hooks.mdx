# Description

Hooks are pieces of logic that are defined to react to specific parts of the codebase. They allow us to follow the SOLID principles.

We use hooks for several advantageous features:

- Decoupling: defining secondary and/or reactionary logic in the form of hooks keep those logic and their relations to the core logic seprate and decoupled allowing us to add and remove augmentations without having to directly modify the core functionality.
- Readability: By breaking down general gameplay logic into hooks we make the different parts
- Reusability: Hooks can be used subsubcribed to different parts of the codebase and reused.
- Contract Size Limit: Solidity limits us to 24kb per contract. using hooks we can break down secondary parts of the game logic so our core contracts are smaller in size

There are two types of hooks we can use

# System Hooks

These are hooks which we subscribe to system calls. they can be called before or after the system function is called and provides us with the function selector, the calling player address and the input parameters of the function

In Primodium we have opted to use Subsystems (Link to Subsystems Page) in combination with modifiers (Link to Modifiers Page) to subsitute system hooks.

# Table Hooks

Table Hooks allows us to define reactionary logic to changes to a table values.

They allow us to define tables with values dependant on other tables but keep their logic decoupled.

In Pridmodium we use them to calculate and store Player and Alliance Scores which themeselves are depandant on different player assets.

The Following example is a hook subscribed to the Score table and updates the AllianceScore table when ever an alliance member score is updated

```
/// @title OnScore_Alliance_Score - Updates alliance scores based on player scores.
contract OnScore_Alliance_Score is StoreHook {
  constructor() {}

  /// @dev This function is called before splicing static data.
  /// @param keyTuple The key tuple of the player score.
  /// @param start The start position of the data.
  /// @param data The data to be processed.
  function onBeforeSpliceStaticData(
    ResourceId,
    bytes32[] memory keyTuple,
    uint48 start,
    bytes memory data
  ) public override {
    bytes32 playerEntity = keyTuple[0];
    bytes32 allianceEntity = PlayerAlliance.getAlliance(playerEntity);

    // Check if the player is part of an alliance
    if (allianceEntity == 0) {
      // If the player is not part of an alliance, there is no alliance score to update
      return;
    }

    bytes memory newScoreRaw = SliceInstance.toBytes(SliceLib.getSubslice(data, start));
    uint256 newScore = abi.decode(newScoreRaw, (uint256));
    uint256 oldScore = Score.get(playerEntity);
    uint256 allianceScore = Alliance.getScore(allianceEntity);

    if (newScore > oldScore) {
      uint256 scoreDiff = newScore - oldScore;
      Alliance.setScore(allianceEntity, allianceScore + scoreDiff);
    } else {
      uint256 scoreDiff = oldScore - newScore;
      Alliance.setScore(allianceEntity, allianceScore - scoreDiff);
    }
  }
}
```
