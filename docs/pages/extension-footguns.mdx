- System names are limited to 16 bytes, anything beyond that will be truncated.
    - If there are multiple systems with the same registered name (due to truncation), your systems may experience divergent behavior.
- Namespace names are limited to 14 bytes, anything beyond that will be truncated.
- Systems should be stateless! If you need to store state, use a table in the namespace.
If you do not follow this convention, adversaries may be able to exploit your system.
- Delegation in its current form can be revoked by the delegator
at any time. A future release will include credibly committed delegations that can
only be revoked under specific conditions.
- System access gives someone the ability to call *any* function in the system. If this is undesirable, either use proper
checks in your functions or break apart your system into multiple systems.
