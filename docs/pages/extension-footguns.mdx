# World Extension Footguns & FAQ

1. System names are limited to 16 bytes, anything beyond that will be truncated.
    - If there are multiple systems with the same name (due to truncation), your systems may experience divergent behavior.
2. Namespace names are limited to 14 bytes, anything beyond that will be truncated.
3. Systems should be stateless! If you need to store state, use a table in the namespace.
If you do not follow this convention, adversaries may be able to exploit your system.
4. Delegation in its current form can be revoked by the delegator
at any time. A future release will include credibly committed delegations that can
only be revoked under specific conditions.
5. System access gives someone the ability to call *any* function in the system. If this is undesirable, either use proper
checks in your functions or break apart your system into multiple systems.
