# Primodium Source

Primodium contracts will be open-sourced in their entirety once the game design and balancing are finalized. Before then, the source code for Primodium tables and interfaces for systems are available, with their role in developing [world extensions](./world-extension.mdx) described in the following pages.

In our development process, we also added supplements to the open [MUD standard](https://mud.dev/) to improve Primodium's internal design and developer experience. Our commitment to open source means that these improvements will be shared as development progresses, such as [Primodium world extensions](./world-extension.mdx) and [prototype generation](./overview-contracts/generation.mdx) scripts.

## Quickstart

Contract [Tables](./overview-contracts/tables.mdx):

- [`/contract-source/codegen/tables`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/developers/blob/main/contract-source/codegen/tables): Generated Solidity contracts for each table.
- [`/contract-source/mud.config.ts`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/developers/blob/main/contract-source/mud.config.ts): Configuration file that defines each table compliant with the open MUD standard.

Contract [Systems](./overview-contracts/systems.mdx):

- [`/contract-source/codegen/world`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/developers/blob/main/contract-source/codegen/world): Generated Solidity interfaces for each publicly-accessible system.

Contract [Prototype Table Data](./overview-contracts/tables.mdx#prototype-tables):

- [`/contract-source/codegen/prototypes/AllPrototype.sol`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/developers/blob/main/contract-source/codegen/prototypes/AllPrototype.sol): Data populated in prototype tables that store game configuration data such as resource requirements and building costs.

Contract [Prototype Generation Scripts](./overview-source/generation.mdx):

- [`/contract-source/codegen/scripts/CreateTerrain.sol`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/developers/blob/main/contract-source/codegen/scripts/CreateTerrain.sol): [Foundry script](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting) for populating terrain ore distribution.
