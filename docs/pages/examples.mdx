# Primodium World Extension Examples

Source code for the following examples are available [here](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/developers/tree/main/examples/).

The following are example plugins that can be deployed alongside the existing Primodium world contracts.

## Framework for Plugins

- Base world must have a delegation module installed (ex: MUD's existing `StandardDelegationsModule.sol`)
- A plugin with maximum customizability requires new namespaces and systems
- General flow involves delegating control of a base system to a private system in a new namespace, then giving others access to the namespace

### building-upgrade-bounty

A world extension that enables the deployer to issue a private bounty for an outside party
to upgrade the deployer's building on their behalf, in exchange for a reward.

Building upgrades cost resources, and it takes time to accumulate the necessary resources. 
There are some advantages of accelerating resource accumulation when you upgrade a building as soon as possible.
If Alice is going to be AFK and doesn't want to manage running a bot, she can create a building
upgrade bounty and delegate the upgrade to another player, Bob, in exchange for a small reward.

- Alice deploys and registers namespace and private systems for extending game logic
- Alice delegates UpgradeBuildingSystem control to the private system
- Alice deposits escrow (ETH) for the bounty in the private system
- Alice registers namespace access to Bob, Charlie, etc. to enable their participation in the bounty
- Bob calls the private system to upgrade Alice's building
- Bob receives the bounty reward from the private system
