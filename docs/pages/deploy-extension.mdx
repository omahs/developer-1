# Deploy to Primodium

Primodium is currently deployed on an OP Stack testnet hosted by [Caldera](https://www.caldera.xyz) that resolves to the [Ethereum Sepolia testnet](https://sepolia.dev/).

## Testnet Tokens

Before deploying your Primodium plugin, you will need to bridge ETH from Sepolia to the Primodium testnet. After obtaining Sepolia ETH from a faucet, you can bridge to the Primodium testnet using the following [bridge](https://primodium-sepolia.calderabridge.xyz/).

## Testnet Configuration

To deploy a MUD contract to the Primodium testnet for interoperability with the testnet Primodium world contract, use the following deployment settings.

```toml
[profile.caldera-sepolia]
eth_rpc_url = "https://primodium-sepolia.rpc.caldera.xyz/http"
chain_id = 10017
```

TODO for Cometshock: add instructions for specifying the Primodium World Address.
